# tigame
![Demo GIF](./demo.gif)

A tiny 3D game engine, still a work in progress. Uses C++, the SDL2 library, PhysicsFS, and OpenGL.

## Build instructions
If you have SDL2 or PhysicsFS installed in a non-standard location, set the `SDL2DIR` and `PHYSFSDIR` environment variables before running `cmake`.

* Install CMake
* Get Bullet physics engine (tested with [version 2.89](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/tree/2.89)), follow build instructions for your operating system.
* Install libpng and development headers (on most Linux distros, this will already be included)
* Install SDL2 and development headers
* Install [PhysicsFS](https://www.icculus.org/physfs/)
* `mkdir build && cd build`
* `cmake ..`
* `make`
