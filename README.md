# tigame
![Demo GIF](./demo.gif)

A tiny 3D game engine, still a work in progress. Uses C++, the SDL2 library, PhysicsFS, and OpenGL.

Currently, it can display a 3D scene with various objects and some simplistic lighting, load meshes for those objects from an OBJ file, and load textures for those meshes from PNG files. You can also attach components to those objects do to various things, such as look around the scene with mouse input.

## Build instructions
If you have SDL2 or PhysicsFS installed in a non-standard location, set the `SDL2DIR` and `PHYSFSDIR` environment variables before running `cmake`.

Please note that these instructions have been only tested on Linux. They should probably work on macOS, and potentially Windows with some modifications?

* Install CMake
* Get Bullet physics engine (tested with [version 3.08](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/releases/tag/3.08)), follow build instructions for your operating system.
* Install libpng and development headers (on most Linux distros, this will already be included)
* Install SDL2 and development headers
* Install [PhysicsFS](https://www.icculus.org/physfs/)
* `mkdir build && cd build`
* `cmake ..`
* `make`
